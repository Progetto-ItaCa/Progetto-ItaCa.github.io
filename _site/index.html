			<h2 id="what-is-itaca">What is ItaCa?</h2>
			<p>
				During the last <a href="http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/">Category Theory</a> in Edinburgh,
				Scotland, it became apparent how Italians are many in the category theory community: some of us proposed
				to join them all in a semi-official network. This is ItaCa: a group of (not necessarily) young
				mathematicians scattered all around the world. Our name stands for <strong>Ita</strong>lian
				<strong>Ca</strong>tegory theorists, but it also reminds the isle where Odysseus strived so hard to come
				back.
			</p>
			<p>
				The community we would like to create is as open and inclusive as possible, without distinction of
				gender, ethnicity, language, or mathematical opinion. The isle of ItaCa is open to all kinds of
				mathematicians, no matter their nationality and background. It is, however, made by Italians, and more
				generally by category theorists in Italy, and has (will always have?) a core of Italians among the
				organizers and promoters. This is to say: despite its apparent absence from the scenes, Italian category
				theory exists, and strives to come home.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our inaugural Christmas workshop will hopefully bring together most of us, get us to know each other,
				and allow us to discuss our research in a friendly environment. Our hope is that there will be other
				such modest but sincere events meant to connect and unify the community we form.
			</p>
			<p>See you in ItaCa.</p>

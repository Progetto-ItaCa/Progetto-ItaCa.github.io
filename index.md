## What is ItaCa?

Our name stands for **Ita**lian **Ca**tegory theorists, but it also reminds the isle where Odysseus strived so hard to come back.

During the [Category Theory 2019](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/) in Scotland, it became apparent how many Italians are present in the Category Theory community: some of us proposed to join them all in a semi-official network. This is **ItaCa**: a group of mathematicians scattered all around the world, doing Category Theory.

The community we would like to create is as open and inclusive as possible, without distinction of gender, ethnicity, language, or mathematical opinion. The isle of ItaCa is open to all kinds of mathematicians, no matter their nationality and background.

It is, however, made by Italians, and more generally by category theorists in Italy, and has (will always have?) a core of Italians among the organizers and promoters.

This is to say: despite its apparent absence from the scenes, Italian Category Theory exists.

We are still a small community, but we are slowly growing. Feel free to **join us**! In particular, feel free to join our [Google group](mailto:progettoitaca+subscribe@googlegroups.com) sending a subscription email (it can have arbitrary subject and body), and our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/507590330041282/).

In October 2021, we started the first Category Theory course of ItaCa; join us on our [zulip](https://itaca.zulipchat.com/) channel!

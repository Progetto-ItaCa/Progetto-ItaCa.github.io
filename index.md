## What is ItaCa?

Our name is a syllabic acronym: we are **Ita**lian **Ca**tegory theorists, but we also want to hint at the island where Odysseus strived so hard to come back.

During the [Category Theory 2019](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/) in Scotland, it became apparent how many Italians belong to the Category Theory community: some of us proposed to create an official network in which we can grow. This is **ItaCa**: a group of mathematicians scattered all around the world, united by their love for Category Theory and their Italian heritage.

The community we would like to create is as open and inclusive as possible, without distinction of mathematical opinion (or gender, language, ethnicity, ...). The island of ItaCa is open to all kinds of mathematicians, no matter their nationality and background.

It is, however, made by Italians, and more generally by category theorists in Italy, and has a core of Italians among the organizers and promoters.

During the last few years, we have been growing beyond expectation: we organized conferences in Milan, Genoa, Pisa, Turin, Padua. Our sixth workshop in December 2025 hosted almost eighty people, the vast majority of which were Italians.

In parallel with in-person yearly workshops, we organize an online seminar ([ItaCa Fest](pages/fest.html)), usually running from April to November.

We published a [course](pages/course.html) on basic Category Theory on youtube, freely available to everyone.

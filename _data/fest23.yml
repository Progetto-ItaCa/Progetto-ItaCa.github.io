        title: "What is probability theory?"
        abstract: "What is probability theory, and what should it be? I will argue that these are important questions, and that probability theory here is special in that these questions are not as meaningful when asked about other areas of mathematics. The goal of the talk is then to discuss these questions as well as a proposed partial answer with the audience. This partial answer is based on Markov categories and axioms for probability formulated in terms of Markov categories."

        title: "Evidential decision theory via partial Markov categories"
        abstract: "I will present partial Markov categories. In the same way that Markov categories encode stochastic processes, partial Markov categories encode stochastic processes with constraints, observations and updates. In particular, we prove a synthetic Bayes theorem, and we use it to define a syntactic partial theory of observations on any Markov category whose normalisations can be computed in the original Markov category. Finally, we formalise Evidential Decision Theory in terms of partial Markov categories.
This is recent joint work with Mario Román."

        title: "Gödel doctrines and Dialectica logical principles"
        abstract: "In this talk, I will introduce the notion of Gödel doctrine, which is a doctrine categorically embodying both the logical principles of traditional Skolemization and the existence of a prenex normal form presentation for every formula, and I will explain how this notion is related to the Dialectica construction. In particular, building up from Hofstra’s earlier fibrational characterization of de Paiva’s categorical Dialectica construction, I will show that a doctrine is an instance of the Dialectica construction if and only if it is a Gödel doctrine. This result establishes an intrinsic presentation of the Dialectica doctrine, contributing to the understanding of the Dialectica construction itself and its properties from a logical perspective. Finally, I will show how this notion allows us to provide a simple presentation and an explanation in terms of universal properties of the two crucial logical principles involved in the Dialectica interpretation, namely Markov's principle and the principle of independence of premise."

        abstract: "The aim of this talk is to offer an interpretation via doctrines of a classical result in first-order logic, i.e. Henkin’s Theorem (“Every consistent theory has a model”). The theorem is generalized in the language of implicational existential doctrines, focusing on the translation of some key steps in the original proof, such as adding constants to a language and axioms to a theory.

        title: "What should Strong Vector Spaces be? "
        abstract: 'Spaces of generalized power series have been important objects in asymptotic analysis and in the algebra and model theory of valued structures ever since the introduction of the first instances of them by Levi-Civita and Hahn. A key feature in this sort of structures is a notion of formal summability and often "natural" linear maps built in this context (such as derivations) are required to preserve this stronger form of linearity, whence they are called strongly linear. In the talk we will propose a framework for strong linearity: we will argue about a notion of reasonable category of strong vector spaces (r.c.s.v.) generalizing the usual setting for strong linearity and show that up to equivalence there is a universal locally small r.c.s.v. ∑Vect  and it can be construed as a torsion free part of Ind(Vect^op) with respect to an appropriate torsion theory. We will then give a brief description of a monoidal closed structure for ∑Vect  and the relation ∑Vect has with another orthogonal subcategory of Ind(Vect^op) equivalent to the category of linearly topologized vector spaces that are colimits of linearly compact spaces. Finally, we will present some open questions in this setting.'

        title: Bicategorical presentations of étendues
        abstract: |
          Étendues are the Grothendieck topoi that “locally look like a locale”. They are known to admit presentations in terms of étale groupoids, left cancellative Grothendieck sites or Ehresmann sites. On one hand, the presentations in terms of étale groupoids are well-behaved bicategorically: Pronk showed in [2] that the 2-category of étendues is biequivalent to a bicategory of fractions of the 2-category of étale groupoids. On the other hand, left cancellative Grothendieck sites and Ehresmann sites, while enough to provide presentations at the level of the objects, turn out to be too restrictive in order to allow for a bicategory of fractions presentation of the whole 2-category of étendues.
          In this talk we introduce a family of Grothendieck sites, the torsion-free generated Grothendieck sites, which contains the left cancellative ones and does allow to recover the 2-category of étendues as a bicategory of fractions. In addition, we introduce the family of generalized Ehresmann sites, a new family of presentations of étendues enlarging that of Ehresmann sites. In parallel with the bicategorical comparison between left cancellative Grothendieck sites and Ehresmann sites carried out by DeWolf and Pronk in [1], we study the connection between the torsion-free generated Grothendieck sites and the generalized Ehresmann sites with the final goal of proving that generalized Ehresmann sites also allow to recover étendues as a suitable bicategory of fractions.
          This is joint work in progress with Darien DeWolf and Dorette Pronk.

        title: Protoadditive Functors and Pretorsion Theories in Multipointed Context
        abstract: |
          We explore a multipointed version of the definition of a protoadditive functor, in relation to pretorsion theories. We show that a pretorsion theory, whose reflector into the torsion-free part is protoadditive, gives rise to an admissible Galois structure which admits a simple characterization of central extensions. Moreover, multipointed pretorsion theories satisfying mild additional assumptions correspond to stable factorization systems. Interesting examples of such pretorsion theories can be found in MV-algebras, in Heyting algebras, and in the dual of two-valued elementary toposes. Joint work with Andrea Montoli.

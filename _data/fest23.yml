        title: "What is probability theory?"
        abstract: "What is probability theory, and what should it be? I will argue that these are important questions, and that probability theory here is special in that these questions are not as meaningful when asked about other areas of mathematics. The goal of the talk is then to discuss these questions as well as a proposed partial answer with the audience. This partial answer is based on Markov categories and axioms for probability formulated in terms of Markov categories."

        title: "Evidential decision theory via partial Markov categories"
        abstract: "I will present partial Markov categories. In the same way that Markov categories encode stochastic processes, partial Markov categories encode stochastic processes with constraints, observations and updates. In particular, we prove a synthetic Bayes theorem, and we use it to define a syntactic partial theory of observations on any Markov category whose normalisations can be computed in the original Markov category. Finally, we formalise Evidential Decision Theory in terms of partial Markov categories.
This is recent joint work with Mario Román."

        title: "Gödel doctrines and Dialectica logical principles"
        abstract: "In this talk, I will introduce the notion of Gödel doctrine, which is a doctrine categorically embodying both the logical principles of traditional Skolemization and the existence of a prenex normal form presentation for every formula, and I will explain how this notion is related to the Dialectica construction. In particular, building up from Hofstra’s earlier fibrational characterization of de Paiva’s categorical Dialectica construction, I will show that a doctrine is an instance of the Dialectica construction if and only if it is a Gödel doctrine. This result establishes an intrinsic presentation of the Dialectica doctrine, contributing to the understanding of the Dialectica construction itself and its properties from a logical perspective. Finally, I will show how this notion allows us to provide a simple presentation and an explanation in terms of universal properties of the two crucial logical principles involved in the Dialectica interpretation, namely Markov's principle and the principle of independence of premise."

The community of ItaCa is currently working on a course on elementary category theory addressed to Italian students; the present page will host the recordings of our lectures, weekly uploaded on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKdVVjPg_dHhbIiuzLh4Llg).

Our target is the community of young students who, having just started their master studies, will soon have to familiarise with universal properties, limits and colimits, no matter what will be their specialisation.

With few notable exceptions, Italian university lack a course whose main topic is the language of categories; students usually learn [functorial language](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/GrothendieckIntroductionLangageFonctoriel1965.pdf) because it's needed as part of a different topic, algebraic geometry, homological algebra, ring theory. There's no trace of a course "tidying up" the students' mathematical knowledge, unifying the concepts through the few, fundamental ideas of structural mathematics.

Our background is quite diverse; we aim to make this course as interdisciplinary as it can possibly be. The course will be taught in Italian, to bring here as many students as possible, but also to establish a precedent, and to build a nomenclature allowing to _do category theory in Italian_.

Our entire community participated, to varying degrees, in the organization of this course; having to choose a collective name for its teachers, we might as well call ourselves "Οὖτις", the name with which Odysseus deceived Polyphemus to save himself.

We leave it to the readers' imagination which monster, in this analogy, is threatening our future students, who we are teaching to save their lives.

# ItacaFest

ItaCaFest is an online webinar aimed to gather the community of ItaCa. 

The seminar will be live on Zoom every Thursday at 13.00 CET. The password of the meeting is __ItaCa__. The main event will last a couple of hours, but everyone is invited to stay longer for the (scientific) chat. In order to make the scientific conversation smoother we have integrated the STRUMENTO DELLA MORTE DI BEPPE.

In the table below you will notice that every talk comes with some additional material: an abstract (A), the slides (B) and a video (C). We are hosting the video on our YT channel.

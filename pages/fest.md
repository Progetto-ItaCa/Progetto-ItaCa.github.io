# ItacaFest

ItaCaFest is an online webinar aimed to gather the community of ItaCa. 

The seminar will be live on [Zoom]() every __Thursday__ at __13.00 CET__. The password of the meeting is __ItaCa__. 

The main event will last a couple of hours, but everyone is invited to stay longer for the (scientific) chat. In order to make the scientific conversation smoother we have integrated [Whiteboard](https://www.whiteboard.team). We host the video content of this meeting on our [YT channel]().

If you would like to be a speaker, or you want to contact the organizers of the seminar, you can reach us via [email](). Make sure to include the word FEST20 in the subject.

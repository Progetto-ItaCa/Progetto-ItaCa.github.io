When Odysseus left for the Trojan War, he placed Mentor in charge of the education of his son Telemachus, and of Odysseus' palace.

This page contains a list of mentors and topics in category theory and nearby areas; each of them is willing to be contacted by young or less young students, to receive pointers to the literature, reading advices, and more in general whatever support Telemachus might need, studying the topics mentioned.

<ul class="mentor-list">
{%- for m in site.data.mentors | sort: "surname" %}
  <li>
    <strong>{{ m.name }} {{ m.surname }}</strong> 
      {%- if m.webpage %} <a href="{{ m.webpage }}">üåê</a> {%- endif %}
    <a href="mailto:{{ m.email }}">{{ m.email }}</a>
    <br>
    {{ m.topics }}
  </li>
{%- endfor %}
